    <p class="title">Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element
         is responsive ? </p>
    <article>
        <p>Yes it does matter if we use “%”, “em” or “rem”. This is because these are relative units of measurement while
             pixel is an absolute unit of measurement. When we are trying to make a responsive web page, using pixel is a
             bad idea because it won’t change size for different devices with different view port sizes. The relative units
             vary for different sizes and everything is scaled up and down proportionally giving the page a more presentable 
             look. There are some people that suggest the responsiveness can be done using media queries but using the relative 
             units will prevent writing complex media queries and simplifies the work. You can read more about this on <a href="https://www.webfx.com/web-design/make-website-responsive.html" target = "_blank">webFx.com</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, using relative units makes the website adaptive to different setting changes by the user. 
            So basically it is the choice between making a pixel exact control design or to design around changes and user 
            control around their browsing experiences. The user needs to be able to zoom the viewport without loss of content
            or functionality. When users want to use browser font scaling feature by only changing font size and without
            zooming the whole page the difference is observed. If relative units are used for the font size specially rem, 
            they are scaled up or scaled down to a multiple of the root level font. And also if the height of the container
            is also specified using relative units the line spacing is automatically adjusted giving a pleasant result.
            For detailed explanation and examples look at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/building-resizeable-components-relative-css-units/" target = "_blank">cssTricks.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="title">What is the default browser size?</p>
    <article>
        <p>The default root element’s size for almost all browsers is 16px if you don’t apply any CSS rules. 
            This value is used throughout the html when we use rem and %. This means 1rem is equal with 16px 
            and also 100% is the same. When we set the size of a text or other element using pixels like for 
            example when we set font-size as 200p, we are preventing the text from inheriting from the root 
            and setting new values to that specific text. using bigger font size look nicer and it is much easier to skim 
            for relative keywords which improves readability and draw in attention.
            We can also change the value of the default root 
            element’s size in our CSS by setting a different value to the html. To read further about this topic

    <p class="title">Changes in CSS3</p>
    <article>
        <p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) is the visual language of the web, controlling everything visual about a website. 
            The newest version of CSS is CSS3 which has added some major features that make it more powerful.Some of these 
            features are discussed below.</p>
        <p>Flex box: CSS3 introduced flex box layout which made aligning a text or any other element vertically and on the 
        center much easier. This feature is added to adapt the layout of the page according to the different screen sizes 
        and devices. The items of a flex box stretch to fill additional space and shrinks in order to fit into smaller spaces</p>
        <p>It has less complicated and more classified modules: another benefit of CSS3 is that it was able to separate big 
            modules into smaller modules which increase practicality. It has all the previous options but they are classified 
            into smaller parts. Because of the classification of modules into smaller parts, problems that occur can be 
            related to a separate module and they can be solved more easily. It took a lot of time to test a web design 
            in the previous versions of CSS because finding the actual problem was very difficult.</p>
        <p>Responsive CSS grid layout: CSS3 is able to create a more flexible grid for different device sizes. The CSS3 
            grid allows you to create both equal size and unequal size columns so designers can create any complicated 
            layout. In addition it is a two dimensional system so it uses both row and column features which makes it very 
            powerful.</p>
        <p>Backward compatibility and Faster: CSS3 is compatible with its previous version; the previous version can easily
             be readjusted to CSS3. Using CSS3 is recommended because it is faster.</p>
        <p>Text animation: CSS3 has added a way that influences how users interact with the text element of a website. 
            It has made hover adjustments, making words float around and many other animation features possible.</p>
        <p>3D transform: 3D modules that can be used in the website are made using this function. This is 2D transform function 
            with the addition of the z-axis. We can spin, flip or even translate the color of elements on the page and add 
            rotating pictures which looks very appealing to users.</p>
        <p>Media Queries: this option is used to adjust the website according to different sizes and devices, it is used to 
            implement the mobile first mentality design. It is an easy functionality to use despite what most people assume 
            about it. To use it we just have to enclose our CSS code inside a “@media rules” statement and the CSS inside the 
            media query only executes if the rules are satisfied.</p>
        <p>Images and animations: in the previous version of CSS, JavaScript was needed to add and edit images and to add 
            animations to the webpage. On CSS3 this problem was fixed and also other improvements were made. It supports of 
            rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before. And CSS3 
            Transitions are used to make changes in the display. With transitions; an element can seamlessly change size and 
            color and duration for a transition can be set.</p>
        <p>Box sizing: on CSS3 box-sizing allows developers to set size for elements without subtracting padding and border 
            unlike the previous versions the padding and border are included in the size of the element.</p>
